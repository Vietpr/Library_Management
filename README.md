# Library_Management

#Introduction:
During my journey of learning about data structures and algorithms, I came up with an idea for this project. Library management is a challenging topic, and I believe that implementing a small library management project will help me gain a deeper understanding. Below are the key features of this library.

#Features:
Book Management: With the Library Management System, you can easily add new books to the library, providing necessary information such as book ID, title, author, and status. The system keeps track of the status of each book, allowing you to view the entire book collection and delete books when necessary.

Borrowing and Returning: The library system allows users to borrow books from the collection. You can track borrower information and update the book's status accordingly. When a book is returned, the system automatically updates its availability, making it convenient for managing book borrowings.

Search and Retrieval: Searching for books based on their titles is made simple with the Library Management System. You can quickly find books that match a specific title, facilitating the locating and retrieval of books for library users.

Voice-assisted Reading: A unique feature of this library is the ability to read books aloud using text-to-speech technology. The system can convert the text content of PDF books into speech, providing an alternative way to enjoy books and enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users.

#Getting Started:
To use the Library Management System, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

PyPDF2 (pip install PyPDF2): Required for reading PDF books.
gTTS (pip install gTTS): Used to generate audio output from text content.
pygame (pip install pygame): Allows for playing audio to enable voice-assisted book reading.

Please refer to the project's README file for detailed instructions on how to set up and use the Library Management System.
